# Concatenate the out files in all the subdirectories of the current directory
# (partitions of the test set) to a master out file in the current directory.
#
# Due to an error, all the partition out files may have a column header line.
# This is not good for R, which requires only one column header at the top of
# the file. The -H option allows to fix this by outcommenting the column headers
# of all but the first partition files. In a newer version of complement.sh, an
# option for not printing the column  header has been added.
