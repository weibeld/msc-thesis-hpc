Test if Michel automata can be done on mpi.q with 4 GB memory and 72:00:00 hours CPU time limit, and with 2 GB Java heap (no timeout per automaton). If there are memory outs, then Michel have to be done on highmem.q with 16 GB memory, and something like 14 GB Java heap.

There are still 3 versions of the Fribourg construction running on Michel, the ones without the M1 optimisation. So, it depends also on them,  if they can finish th Michel automata without a memory out.

--> Result: there are memory outs with mpi.q, 4 GB, thus, definitely all Michel must be done with
     - highmem.q
     - 16 GB
     - 72:00:00
     - 14 GB Java heap
     - No timeout
