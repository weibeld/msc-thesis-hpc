New runs after restarting working on the thesis, improving most scripts, and determining which data is actually needed for the thesis


Test data
---------
  - Size 15 GOAL test set automata (the size 20 automata are note used anymore)
  - Michel automata N1 (3 states) to N4 (6 states)


Complementation
---------------
All the GOAL and Michel automata are complemented with the following constructions and options:
  - Internal
      1. fribourg
      2. fribourg+r2c
      3. fribourg+r2c+c
      4. fribourg+m1
      5. fribourg+m1+m2
      6. fribourg+m1+r2c
      7. fribourg+m1+r2c+macc+r 
  - External


Completeness
------------
All the GOAL automata are tested for completeness


Universality
------------
All the GOAL automata are tested for universtality


Correctness
-----------
For showing the correctness of the implementation, we take the tests from jobs/2014-11-25. Another set of tests could be done in the future.
