Investigation: how far the runs that take too long get in 72 hours?

Execution of some of the runs that take too long on mpi.q with log and out file in home directory.

The jobs will not finish, but it will be possible to get an idea of how long they might take in total.

rank -tr -ro (size 15)
rank (size 15)
fribourg (size 20, timeout 600s, memory 1G)
fribourg (size 20, timeout 1200s, memory 2G)

Result (07.12.2014): all jobs could complement more or less one quarter of the automata (between 2500 and 3000). I will handle this by dividing the test sets in 5 partitions and assign one partition per job. Every job should be able to finish its partition in 72 hours on mpi.q (see 2014-12-07).
