First attempt for serious internal and external experiment for size 20.

There are two limitation variants:
1) Timeout 600s, memory 1G
2) Timeout 1200s, memory 2G

Many runs have been aborted due to exceeding the home directory disk quota (because of the core dump files that have previously not been deleted). 
Runs for piterman and slice are ok.

Runs for fribourg (without options) and for rank do not fit in 72 hours.
