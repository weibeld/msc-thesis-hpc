- Serious universality test for the automata in the size 15 and size 20 test set.
    - Size 15: successul
    - Size 20: memory outs (constructions with all options)
        - piterman: 2G
        - slice:    4G
        - fribourg: 2G
- Second attempt of serious internal test (size 15). Without zstates in complement.sh.
  Only most essential option configurations
- First serious attempt of external test (size 15)
    - Restarted rank -tr -ro on long.q with 360:00:00 CPU time and out and log file in home directory, because it didn't finish within 72:00:00 hours on mpi.q.
        - Other solution than long.q for jobs that take too long: partition test set and run a separate job for each partition. See 2014-12-07.
